# Homebrew cask for Junction.
#
# This repo doubles as its own tap (Casks/ at the repo root). The release
# workflow bumps `version` and `sha256` here automatically on each tagged release.
#
# Until builds are notarized, macOS quarantines the app whatever Homebrew does,
# so installing takes a follow-up xattr (see caveats).

  caveats <<~EOS
    Junction is not yet notarized, so macOS will block the first launch until you
    clear the quarantine flag:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Junction.app"
